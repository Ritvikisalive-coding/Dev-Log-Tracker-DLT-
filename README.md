## Dev Log Tracker (DLT)

Dev Log Tracker is a simple to use GUI based app that allows you to store, view and track your progress when it comes to your projects. Made a small tweak or fixed a bug? Ad a new Dev Log Entry. Taken a long break from your project and forgot what you did last? View your old entries. 

## Wheres it stored

DLT is a 100% offline app. This means the only time you need to use the internet for it is to download the app to begin with. DLT stores all your dev logs in a locally stored .db File if you wish to back up this file to another storage location an export button can be found in the settings tab.

## Can i run it from a USB and have a 100% Portable Dev Log

As it is early development days this has yet to be determined. But it is my goal to make this app portable as well as installable. Upon first launch the app should ask if you have a db file or would like to make one. If for some reason at a later date you wish to change the .db File or you want to load one that you share with others this can be done through the Settings Tab located near the Export button.

## Will it be maintained.

The app is a simple program that doesn't require much in terms of maintenance but if required i will recompile for newer versions of operating systems as well as respond to and try and fix any issues mentioned in the issues tab on Github

## Last bit of info

Please bear with me as this is the start to hopefully a long line of side projects which will be tracked via this app so i will be able to vouch for it if required. As this is the start my knowledge when it comes to GUI designing and creation isnt the best as of yet so early versions may look old / outdated but once my knowledge improves or i get help i will aim to improve my apps if i can.


## Where to download?

Download the program for windows via the Releases tab on Github. MacOS and Linux i have yet learnt how to compile apps for so those two may take slightly longer to get released in the beginning but hopefully all three platforms should be updated together.

### Any future plans for the apps expansion?

In the future i hope to migrate the locally stored db to be an option where you can alternativly use a file stored on a cloud server that i run making your dev logs accesable regardless the device you open the app from.
I also hope to one day expand the app from desktop to also Mobile platforms this includes iOS, iPadOS and Android
